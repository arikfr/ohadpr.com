		<description>Nice idea :)
I would love to be able to leave comments that link to specific places in blog posts, just as you do when comment on word document. Contextual comments are better at pointing out specific points, although they are unnecessary if you want to make some general point in you comment (like this one :) )
Do you know of any Wordpress plugin that does something similar?</description>
