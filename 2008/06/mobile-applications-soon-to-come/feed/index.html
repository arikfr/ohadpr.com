		<description>Anti-stood-up is a very cool idea to top it, and it can prevent you from making that call to apologize for your latency as your meeting partner/s can see that you are no where close to location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How will no background processing affect this app though?</description>

		<description>yes. quite cool! here are some more features for your app:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;anti-stood-up: get an alert if your buddy is not even close to where you&#039;re about to meet him :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;alert time that is auto-adjusted not just by the distance, but also by the traffic status (to save you from those embarrassing &quot;i&#039;m late&quot; calls.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;now, did it happen to you that you shut off the alert, but then it still took you 20 min to actually leave the office?? well, this alert will scream again if you didn&#039;t leave in 5 min (it knows that you are still there..)</description>
