		<description>i don&#039;t appreciate some of their tactics either, but regardless (or sometimes due to) these tactics, they create amazing products with huge reach and huge potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;compare the iphone to some windows-mobile device for example. on one side we have no application distribution channel whatsoever, and on the other we have a fully integrated one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;developers will not understand usually but this essentially makes the difference between a platform that will succeed with 3&#039;rd party software and one that relies on 3&#039;rd party sites for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i mean, its so huge that its barely even comparable. hold on a few months and count things like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 3&#039;rd party software developers revenue from iphone applications.&lt;br/&gt;* number of 3&#039;rd party software apps, will surely surpass palm/wm/bb even though iphone market share is smaller.&lt;br/&gt;* quality of apps.</description>

<p>compare the iphone to some windows-mobile device for example. on one side we have no application distribution channel whatsoever, and on the other we have a fully integrated one.</p>
<p>developers will not understand usually but this essentially makes the difference between a platform that will succeed with 3&#8242;rd party software and one that relies on 3&#8242;rd party sites for this.</p>
<p>i mean, its so huge that its barely even comparable. hold on a few months and count things like:</p>
<p>* 3&#8242;rd party software developers revenue from iphone applications.<br />* number of 3&#8242;rd party software apps, will surely surpass palm/wm/bb even though iphone market share is smaller.<br />* quality of apps.</p>

		<description>I really don&#039;t understand the hype around apple&#039;s products. This is a company that will do whatever it can to limit its users from unlocking the full potential of their products. They do all they can to maximize on their profit on the backs of their customers and developers.&lt;br/&gt;What puzzles me most is that developers like you are playing along with this and continue developing for their platform.</description>
