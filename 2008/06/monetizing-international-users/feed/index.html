		<description>Great topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amit is absolutely right. But some points to think about:&lt;br/&gt;1. The most naïve thought is like this: Coke is a global brand. Coke is being consumed in all the countries. All coke country managers advertise Coke. That means that you can get ad dollars in every country in the world.&lt;br/&gt;2. I heard that Google is monetizing really well in Eastern Europe.&lt;br/&gt;3. We have seen ad networks emerge all across the world now, the problem is that you need to partner with each one independently to start monetizing.&lt;br/&gt;4. Clearly, the US is a much more mature region with higher CPCs/CPMs. However the competition is also crazy&lt;br/&gt;5. UK is the #1 country in means of monetization (All companies say that…)&lt;br/&gt;6. One final comment: It is now agreed that you can create a $1bn consumer internet company in Germany alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line: International is an opportunity but hard work.</description>
