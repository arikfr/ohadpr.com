		<description>pingie was problematic at the begining but i&#039;ve been using it for 2 months now and its been working good.

I fed it a yahoo pipes RSS and its ok. I just went it to try and look at the configuration but pingie&#039;s control panel is very weird so I couldn&#039;t make much of it.

try a few more times, try a different URL, maybe it doesn&#039;t like the pipe&#039;s URL?</description>

		<description>So i created a yahoo pipe and also wanted to channel it through pingie (google search on that is how I found you).  that said, when I paste the feed into pingie, it doesn&#039;t work.  

did you encounter this?  any suggestions?</description>
