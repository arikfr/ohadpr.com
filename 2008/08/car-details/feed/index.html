		<description>:-) we took the prius and i&#039;m happy with it. the mini is cool but very rough on the road (tight suspension) and its really TINY, but definitely cooler.</description>

		<description>That is assuming you get the milage on the Prius that they advertise, which is difficult if you are not watching their video game like screen to lower consumption of fuel.

I&#039;d go with the Mini which gets you there in a sporty manner; plus you would be able to park it quickly nearly anywhere once you arrive! :)

Or just use CalTrain to work for an hour with a 3G card.  What happened to the WiFi tests they were doing anyway?</description>
