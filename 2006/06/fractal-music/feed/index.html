		<description>@Alex: I haven&#039;t used this code for a long time, I&#039;m sure if you look through the python files you&#039;ll find the reference.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m trying to work fractal  music with Python, just for hobbie, but I&#039;m new in programming tasks.  In what directory must I insert the python-midi files, please?  I apologize for my bad English.</description>

		<description>some of them sounds odd,&lt;br/&gt;some sound pretty cool,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;nevertheless they are good raw-material for musicians, they can use the data in all sorts of way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i&#039;m working on a small interactive program which should be very fun for some, and maybe even productive for some other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I agree with what &#039;anonymous&#039; has to say</description>

		<description>but ohad, it sounds awful.&lt;br/&gt;people with Synaesthesia can actually see what they hear.&lt;br/&gt;there&#039;s a leak in the brain between the sensor&#039;s input and the perception processing. now look at the fractal. what does it sound like ? i think it sounds similar to what you recorded. i suspect one type of stimulus has no intelligible mapping to the other.</description>

		<description>that&#039;s the biggest problem,&lt;br/&gt;most people who think of fracatl music use lots of hand-movements and talk about big things, sometimes finding it hard to express their exact thoughts about the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;although it is more or less impossible to hear hte song at once, we can try to listen to many simulatenous channels of music, all representing different paths along this fractal.</description>

		<description>I am so glad I discovered your blog about the fractal music. I have been thinking about the possibility of making fractal music. I saw some old show on PBS about two months ago. To be totally honest with you I am not a math guy, and I don’t understand the math end of fractals. Here’s what I was thinking. The problem with music is that we hear it linearly. There is now way to hear the entire song at once. You look at a whole picture top, bottom, etc. When I look at fractals I feel the need to see all of them. If there was a way to duplicate fractals using some sort of 3d music it would be really cool. I don’t know if this makes any sense or is any help, but I would love to hear more of your thoughts.</description>
