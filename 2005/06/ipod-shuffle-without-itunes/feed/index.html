		<description>I would like to thank Martin Fiedler for his program and Ohad Eder-Pressman for his conversion to an exe. Also I thank the commenters here who have contributed to my understanding. 

If you run rebuild_db in a command prompt with a -h option the result is:

V:\&gt;rebuild_db\rebuild_db -h 
Usage: rebuild_db\rebuild_db [OPTION]... [DIRECTORY]... 
Rebuild iPod shuffle database. 
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too. 
-h, --help         display this help text 
-i, --interactive  prompt before browsing each directory 
-v, --volume=VOL   set playback volume to a value between 0 and 38 
-s, --nosmart      do not use smart shuffle 
-n, --nochdir      do not change directory to this scripts directory first 
-r, --root         go to the root directory of the drive containing the script/executable 
-l, --nolog        do not create a log file 
-L, --logfile      set log file name 
Must be called from the iPod&#039;s root directory. By default, the whole iPod is searched for playable files, unless at least one DIRECTORY is specified.

Note that each option has two methods of invocation. The long version must be preceded by two dashes while the short version has only a single dash before one character. This explains the problem some were having.

Clearly the directory argument offers some interesting possibilities.

Thanks again!</description>

		<description>I have tried it, and I can tell you rebuild_db.py does NOT work on the 3rd gen shuffle. I think the voice over stuff messes it up.</description>

		<description>Pimp.
I had to use the -r instead of -root modification as well.</description>

		<description>Thanks for this, worked superbly though I had the same problem as lbot above and had to manually type in the bat file entry plus change -root to -r
I also had to change the -nolog to -n (with -nolog the exe was parsing -o as well as -n)

Just in case anybody is as stupid as me - you also have to copy the zip file inside the distribution zip file into \rebuild_db</description>

		<description>1 found two bugs i had to fix. but now it works great. thanks 8 ) 

1. don&#039;t cut and past &quot;rebuild_db\rebuild_db.exe –root –nolog&quot; in to notepad unless you change the font. if you look at the output from the batch you will see that the &quot;-&quot; get miss interpret with this font. weird i know but the - turn into a u with a accent over it.
2. don&#039;t use the full -root it reads the -r and then didnot know what to do with the oot. just use the -r


you may not find this, but if you get stuck give them a try and see if it helps.</description>
