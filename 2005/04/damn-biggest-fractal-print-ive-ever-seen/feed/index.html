		<description>I just got one of my fractals printed too. It was a 100 megapixel image, which i pieced together from 25 seperate 4 megapixel images. At 300dpi it printed at 85 by 85 centimetres. I don&#039;t think i could do one as big as yours though as the computer wouldn&#039;t be able to open the image for printing lol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a HREF=&quot;http://fc02.deviantart.com/fs19/f/2007/244/c/8/Rainbow_goo_by_Jinmane.jpg&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the image i got printed. It cost me £50 (that&#039;s $100) to print which i thought was a bit much lol, but worth it i guess.</description>

		<description>This is terrific! But pardon my ignorance - what do I do with the source code or binary? Which program generates a working fractal-generating program from it?</description>

		<description>Hey pengas is right. You could open a store and sell posters of fractals. I&#039;ve always thought that they look cool. And I have a friend whose house decoration would look good with a fractal like that.</description>
