		<description>i think this is one of the biggest opportunities for FB right now, but since - as u mentioned - google are on the same race, let&#039;s see which of the following will happen -&lt;br/&gt;1. microsoft buying FB and putting their web office on individual networks&lt;br/&gt;2. google buying FB and putting their web applications on networks&lt;br/&gt;3. no one buying facebook, FB itself developing corporate applications (UNLIKELY)&lt;br/&gt;4. 3rd party company delivers a killer app for this&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i still think google will buy FB, but as time goes by i guess the price goes high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gil</description>
